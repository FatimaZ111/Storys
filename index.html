    <h1>The cat…</h1>
    <p>
There was silence for a moment. Look I am trusting you but   it’s a risk.  That’s not trusting!  You have to let us go If he goes maybe he will not be able to bring that much food.<br>
Ah! Roxanne shouted. Everybody went over there Roxanne was awake. We told her what was happening. Roxanne you will stay because I don’t think you have fully recovered.<br>
 She agreed.You have to let us go, please. Ok Mrs. Sofia finally agreed.
</p>
<p>
I’ll help you get everything ready, quick. Ok. After few minutes of preparing and making rules we were ready to go.<br>
We all had mobiles so we had a voice call and with Mrs. Sofia too. We all had dark clothes so we couldn’t be spotted easily.<br>
Mrs. Sofia had a scared and a nervous face.</p>
<p>
We went saying our good byes. We were together. We were almost there. Quiet. We saw a mad person going over there.<br>
Dad! She whispers. We split up. We sneaked in from the back door of the mall. We were crouching. We saw Alex’s dad crouched, hiding from the mad person. We stayed there.<br>
 When the mad person was gone we crouched to him. What are you doing here? Long story. We took some stuff very careful.We divided the categories of food. Lizzy and I got breakfast.<br>
I went in the cereal aisle getting some cereals.While Lizzy was getting eggs. After that we took that we went to check on others they were ready.</p><br>
 <p>
We went home safely. Mrs. Sofia was delighted to see us. Ok now why were these kids there. Does it matter we helped you a lot Alex said? Aha agreed her dad. What did you get?<br>
 asked Mrs. Sofia. All of the foods I mean breakfast, lunch, supper, dinner and a little a bit of desert.Well the good news is Roxanne is alright.<br>
 Who’s ready for lunch! We all cheered. Mind a little help in the kitchen Lizzy. No problem mom. You can prepare the desert and I shall prepare the dinner Darling.<br>
The other of us played happily. Our mothers and fathers would keep calling us from the day we were here. we made loads of noise. The grandmother keeps telling us to quiet down but we don’t.<br>
 we don’t mean not to listen to her.</p>
 <p>
Thump! Thump! came the noises somebody was thumping on the door, everyone stared at the door. Come here boys and give me a hand. They put a small little cabinet in front <br>
 of the door it was not that big though not even that heavy I think it was like 24,25 kg.</p>
 <p>
Thump! Came the noise again. It’s going to be ok said Mr. Cody, Alex’s Father. And everyone went back to their work they were doing Thump! Thump! <br>
 The noise kept going for a minute or two. Then it got much louder! We all stopped what we were doing and stared at it, curious. Thump! Thump! What do we do now I asked? <br>
 Ok, if they get in you all need to hide don’t care about anything do as you are said take it seriously and quiet.We agreed. Boys put things in front of the door. We went there and <br>
  I put a little table in front of it. And we need to cooperate be friends with everybody in this house! Thump! </p>
<p>
 We could see that the door was about to break! Take weapons. we all took some stuff. Mr. Cody took a kitchen knife. I took a scissor form the kitchen my friend took a frying pan and <br>
 so did my friends took stuff.Quiet. We all got ready. The noise stopped There was silence no one moved a muscle. Then everybody sighed with relief.<br>
 And went to what they were doing after half an hour. Dinner is ready shouted Mrs. Sofia. We were in Alex’s room playing Brookhaven together. There was a delicious smell around.<br>
  We ran over there happily and curious that what was in dinner that smelled so good.
It was stew it smelled so good and it looked so delicious.</p>
<p>
    We went and sat on the dining table. Wow Mrs. Sofia this looks and smells delicious. Thanks. It was delicious. After dinner came the desert.<br>
     There was excitement in the air. Lizzy came in with a tray of some cold ice-cream. Yay! shouted Robert I love Ice0cream I bet you guys do too!<br>
      We all nodded our heads happily.</p>
      <p>
We dived in! After Half an hour of enjoying Ice-cream. We all sat happily and talked. Mr. Cody turned on the T.V.<br>
                          <strong> <em>            T.V <br>
Host: We are here again with Dr. lupin with another mysterious discovery.<br>
Dr. lupin: We have found some mysterious bacteria in the body of the mad rat. These mad rat humans are not a shock that got to these rats.<br>
 But we suspect it is a virus we long to find its Cure and learn more about this mysterious virus.<br>
  Host: How mysterious a virus! Has the cat gave this virus to us??<br>

Dr. lupin: Maybe, we don’t know yet but we soon shall. It’s better for you to stay home and away from theses mad rats!<br>
Host: Once again stay safe stay in your house and away from these mad rats! ~ ~ ~ <br></p></strong></em>
<p>
Mr. Cody turned the volume low. A virus! *gasps* when are they going to tell more information? Such a twist! Mrs. Sofia exclaimed.<br>
 H-ow? Wha-at? We don’t know Belle, Alex’s grandma said. WHAT!! Roxane shouted. What happened we said. Our parents and friends and I don’t know who are in danger, from the virus!<br>
  There is more risk now! Yes, more risk. Then we all when to sleep, worried.</p>
  <p>
In the morning, I woke up. I went to the kitchen after brushing my teeth and there were pancakes topped with caramel. After breakfast Mr. Cody made us do study. Then he made us read a book, it <br>
was a little hard choosing my book there were just so many books to choose from. The book I choose was pretty nice!
We had to read for an hour, my book was still not finished.<br>
 Then I played roblox with everyone. After three hours of playing Roblox. We played among us for almost one and a half hour. It was really fun. Then one by one we got called for a bath. <br>
  After everyone took a bath. We were called for lunch.There was orange juice with some crunchy fried potatoes, I dident know its name. We ate our food. Do you know anything else <br>
   about this virus?
 I asked. No, maybe they will tell us more in the T.V saying this he turned on the TV.</p> <br>
                           <strong> <em>     <p> TV <br>
Host: This virus is spreading immensely!! If I guess how many rats have been infected this mysterious virus the number would be big…. I guess 3000 rats or more! Isent it a huge number of rats!<br>
 Oh! Another colony is calling in. let’s see what they want to say.<br>
 Colony: Hello!<br>
Host: Ah, yes the Madison colony!<br>
Madison Colony: We are reporting on a virus here. are there any traces in the other colony’s?<br>
Host: Oh my, Yes! There is a virus here too!<br>
Madison Colony: What! Is it the virus that drives people mad?<br>
Host: Yes! Have you been in contact with other colony’s?<br>
Madison Colony: Leave it to us! We are doing it! But this was the first colony we got in contact our men are on to it…. Oh! Our men just told us that many more colonies have been affected too!<br>
Host: Oh no! Do you have any news from the world health organization!<br>
Madison Colony: Yes from docter lupin! I believe you must have heard it too. But no not any other.<br>
Host: yes, all of the colonies are in contact with the WHO.<br>
Madison colony: Ok, bye.<br>
Host: Bye.</p> <br>
<p></em> </strong>
Mr. Cody turned down the volume with subtitles on. Oh no!
I was thinking that we all including their parents, grandmother’s should go in another colony but it’s a pandemic now! Mrs. Sofia said scared. What are we going to do? VOLUME! I shouted!<br>
 He is talking about WHO virus information!
He turned the volume up.</p><br>
<p>
                    <strong> <em>                TV <br>
HOST: WHO just gave us more news.<br>
Dr. lupin: We have found out more information about this mysterious virus. It is a new virus and has been named as the <br>
‘’EBOLA virus’’, Now for how do we get this virus, you get bitten…after 5-10 seconds you become mad…or the mutated rat. Mutated rat basically means a... zombie. We update you if we get more <br>
 information. Thankyou.<br>
HOST: Oh!<br>
</p></em> </strong>
<p>
Mr. Cody turned down the volume. There was silence. A zombie!!!! Shouted Robert Macalester. This is madness! Mutated Rats! Zombies! Zombies were in tales! This is rubbish Robert Shouted.<br>
 What is it then? They sure look like zombies. Mutated rats to me. it is hard to believe, but it sure does look true. *Sighs* yeah… Robert said. <br>
There was silence. Ok a zombie virus so let’s just. I don’t know it’s very hard to believe.</p> <br>
<p>
Ok bed said Mrs. Sofia. Want me to read you a bedtime story? We are not kid’s mom *sighs*. Ok.<br> </p>
<p>
In the morning. Mr. Cody made all of us too sit and listen to him. Look as you know about the zombie thing we need to have some rules it’s for your own <br>
safety it may happen to any of us we don’t know when and this thing is very mad we need rules.Now it’s for kids and adults. Don’t argue that you are not kids. But... dad <br>
 NO just look out there are there just kids mad? There are big people mad too. It could be us any of us no matter who they are.</p> <br>
 <p>
Ok now whatever you were doing and don’t forget this though. Ok we all said I just simply nodded my head. Mrs. Sofia went to make breakfast It was half already made. <br>
 After ten minutes’ breakfast was ready We were almost finished that Mr. Cody said that after some minutes a news stream will start with Dr. Lupin and the stream many colonies will be  <br>
 live too in the stream.  He ordered Alex to bring the T.V remote. He started the T.V <br></p>
                  <strong> <em>    <p>           TV
There was a countdown 2:02 2:03 …….  1:00 …. 0:30
….. 0:01… <br>
   HOST: Welcome broadcasting live with many colony’s and Dr. lupin! With more information about these mutated rat’s aka zombies....  <br>
Dr. lupin: Ok so These mutated rats are completely mot human I mean by that is that’s they are dead theres no more brain or heart in them they are not a rat when they are bitten <br>
And you are free to murder them.<br>
Colony 3: Do you know what caused this?<br>
Dr. lupin: No we are working on it but we have seen that there are some changes that’s have been happened but our previous information wasn’t worng either it’s a change. <br>
 Before was that after a bite in 5-10 seconds the rat who has been bitten will become a zombie but now They will become a zombie in 1 minute to a minute and 30 seconds. <br>
Colony 7:  are the new changes more danger if are so how? <br>
Dr. lupin: it can be more easy and more dangerous in ways in because In those minutes maybe somebody helps him or her not knowing that he or she is infected. <br> </p> </em> </strong>
<p><strong> <em>
Now for the good way if there is a lot of them and some rats get bitten so they also get time to escape or do something, last words or whatever. It is really mysterious how <br>
 this happened I mean that how did it get on all the colony’s so fast a pandemic lets say * sighs* well we are creating a website which tell you about this virus and how much it is spreading <br>
  every day the name is WHO Ebola virus. That’s all for now! <br> </p> </em> </strong>
  <p>
Mr. Cody turned off the T.V. So everybody there were some changes and we all should really take care Mr. Cody said. After breakfast reading! The same book that you were reading it’s your choice.</p><br>
                          <p>      3 days later
I woke up next morning I was early all the other kids were sleeping. Mr. and Miss Cody were awake they were worried. Are you- *yawns* ok? I asked them sleepily wondering why were they worried. <br>
 Oh! Go wake the other kids will ya? Well tell you all together bill. Ok I went in the room turned on the lights. I was rubbing my eyes madly WAKEEE Wake up! I shouted few of them woke up. <br>
  Then eventually they all did. we all went where Mr. and misses Cody were. Well sit down on the couch everybody. Mrs. Cody and Mr. Cody sat too.<br>
 Ok, we need to discuss. So… Mr. Cody continued as you know we have been preparing some stuff for the future we have ran out of food we will need to go to the supermarket again. But we are  <br>
 afraid that there might be no more food left in super market. <br> </p>
 <p>
Waaaa- it are you telling me we need to go to the central! There would be madness there as it’s the central place of our town [ our half town is there] really? The central supermarket well  <br>
let’s agree there will be lots food there because NO ONE DARES TO GO THERE! Robert continued STOP! Did we ever say about going to the central!?!? Shouted misses Sofia.  <em>Central was a nice place <br>
 there with our green water lakes which came out huge pipes there was happiness there until the virus came. Which I belive humans call a sewer which they are disgusting but not for us we rat! </em> <br>
Ok look we have to go for a food hunt by going in houses because as in the WHO website its not going good in our colony.<br> </p>
<p>
More than half of our colony would be dead *phone rings* I’ll get it! Said Roxanne * answers phone*. It’s for you bill. *I run over there and she hands me the phone* Hello? *talks* *stuns* <br>
*drops phone* *sobs* Everybody looked at me curious. *Robert runs to me* are you ok? What happened by now everybody was there beside me. These words left my lips…. My father is... <br>
*everybody looks down and sobs fill the air* those words were barely spoken.@@@ </p> <br>
